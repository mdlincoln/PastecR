This is my first submission.

## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.3
* Travis-CI Ubuntu 14.04, R 3.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

There was one NOTE: Both "API" and "Pastec" were flagged as possible spelling errors in the DESCRIPTION. "Pastec" is the appropriate name for the program whose application programming interface this package wraps, and I hope that "API" is an acceptable abbreviation for said interface.

The large components are image files used for tests and building vignettes.

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs
